# Final project of the course "Certificação Bootstrap".

This is the last active of the course "Certificação Bootstrap". It's a course about the framework bootstrap. The purpose of this active was build a responsive dashboard, only seeing an design image.

To improve my skills i decided to code and implement the charts of the dashboard, instead of put images on it.
